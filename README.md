## 🔄 Procedure / Methodology
The project was executed using the following structured approach:

### 1. Data Understanding & Cleaning
Reviewed dataset structure, handled missing and zero ratings, standardized categorical values, and converted pricing fields into numeric format.

### 2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Analyzed distributions and relationships across:
- Restaurant ratings and votes
- Online order and table booking availability
- Cost for two vs rating
- Location-wise restaurant density
- Cuisine and restaurant type popularity

### 3. Visualization & Insight Generation
Used visual exploration to compare restaurant performance across different dimensions and derive business insights.
